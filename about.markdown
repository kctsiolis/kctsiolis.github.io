I am from Laval, Quebec, Canada and currently reside there. After graduating from my high school, 
[Royal West Academy](https://royalwestacademy.com), in 2016, I obtained a DEC in Pure and Applied Science from [Vanier College](https://vaniercollege.qc.ca)
in 2018. There, I took part in numerous extra-curricular activities, such as the [Key Society](https://vaniercollege.qc.ca/learning-commons/key-society/),
Tech Club, and [LaunchBox](https://vaniercollege.qc.ca/stem/launchbox/), the latter of which is a program helping students build innovative
startups. My team's project, MathBuddy, a system which uses handwriting recognition to correct
students' mistakes on math problems, won 1st place in the LaunchBox Demo Day competition, where we debuted our prototype.

Currently, I am in the Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca). I
have been conducting research in natural language processing under [Professor Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung) at 
[Mila](https://mila.quebec), the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, since May 2019. I am also an Academic Lecturer at the [McGill Artificial Intelligence Society](https://mcgillai.com) for Fall 2020 and Winter 2021, where I co-teach the [MAIS 202](https://mcgillai.com/bootcamp) bootcamp, an introductory machine learning course for undergraduate students with no prior ML experience.
