I am from Laval, Quebec, Canada and currently reside there. After graduating from my high school, 
[Royal West Academy](https://royalwestacademy.com), in 2016, I obtained a DEC in Pure and Applied Science from [Vanier College](https://vaniercollege.qc.ca) in 2018, where I discovered my passion for machine learning. I took part in numerous extra-curricular activities, such as the [Key Society](https://vaniercollege.qc.ca/learning-commons/key-society/), Tech Club, and [LaunchBox](https://vaniercollege.qc.ca/stem/launchbox/), the latter of which is a program helping students build innovative startups. My team's project, MathBuddy, a system which uses handwriting recognition to correct students' mistakes on math problems, won 1st place in the LaunchBox Demo Day competition, where we debuted our prototype.

Currently, I am in the Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca). In my first two summers, I conducted natural language processing (NLP) research under [Professor Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec), the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, since May 2019. I am currently a research assistant in [Professor Adam Oberman's lab](https://www.adamoberman.net/). Our work focuses on representation learning for computer vision.

I was also an Academic Lecturer at the [McGill Artificial Intelligence Society](https://mcgillai.com) in the Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 semesters. In this role, I co-taught the [MAIS 202](https://mcgillai.com/bootcamp) bootcamp, an introductory machine learning course for undergraduate students with no prior ML experience.
