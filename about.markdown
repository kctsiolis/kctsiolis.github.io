I am from Laval, Quebec, Canada and currently reside there. After graduating from my high school, 
Royal West Academy, in 2016, I obtained a DEC in Pure and Applied Science from Vanier College
in 2018. There, I took part in numerous extra-curricular activities, such as the Key Society,
Tech Club, and LaunchBox, the latter of which being a program helping students build innovative
startups. My team's project, MathBuddy, a system which uses handwriting recognition to correct
students' mistakes on math problems, won 1st place in the LaunchBox Demo Day competition. My team
and I continue to work on this project to this day.

Currently, I am in the Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program at McGill University. I
have been conducting research in natural language processing under Professor Jackie Cheung at 
Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, since May 2019.
