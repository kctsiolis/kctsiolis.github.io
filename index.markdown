Hello! My name is Konstantinos Christopher ("KC") Tsiolis. I am a third-year Honours Mathematics and Computer Science student at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca). I conduct research in natural language processing (NLP) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec) and the [McGill Reasoning and Learning Lab](https://rl.cs.mcgill.ca) under the supervision of [Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung). My research interests include (but are not limited to) commonsense reasoning, pragmatics, and distributional semantics. In Fall 2020 and Winter 2021, I will be co-teaching the [MAIS 202](https://mcgillai.com/mais202) bootcamp, an extra-curricular course in machine learning for undergraduates at McGill.

You can view my CV [here](cv.pdf).
