Hello! My name is Konstantinos Christopher ("KC") Tsiolis. I am a first-year M.Sc. student in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec) under the supervision of Adam Oberman. My current research is on self-supervised representation learning and its application to problems in computer vision. 

I graduated with a B.Sc. from McGill in Honours Mathematics and Computer Science in 2021, which is also when I began working with my current supervisor. During my first two summers of undergraduate studies I was a research assistant in natural language processing (NLP) under the supervision of [Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung), where I worked on word representation learning and computational pragmatics.

My broad area of interest is in machine learning. More specifically, my main research interests include (but are not limited to) representation learning, self-supervised learning, deep learning theory, robustness, and out-of-distribution generalization. 

You can view my CV [here](cv.pdf).
