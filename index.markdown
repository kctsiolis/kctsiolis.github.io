<h2>Bio</h2>
Hello world! My full name is Konstantinos Christopher Tsiolis, but I go by my initials "KC". I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) under the supervision of [Murat Erdogdu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/). I am broadly interested in developing a rigorous theoretical understanding of deep learning. More specifically, my current research involves using tools from high-dimensional probability to describe the behaviour of stochastic optimization methods.

I proudly hail from beautiful Montreal, QC and completed my previous studies there. I received my M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec) under the supervision of [Adam Oberman](https://www.adamoberman.net/). My [thesis research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02651.pdf) was on contrastive self-supervised learning methods. During this time, I also collaborated with [Elliot Paquette](https://elliotpaquette.github.io) on random matrix theory for neural networks.

I graduated with a B.Sc. from McGill in Honours Mathematics and Computer Science in 2021. During my first two summers of undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant at Mila and the [McGill Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca) under the supervision of [Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung), where I worked on word embeddings and computational pragmatics.
