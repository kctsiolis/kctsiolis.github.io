Hello! My name is Konstantinos Christopher ("KC") Tsiolis. I am an Honours Mathematics and Computer Science student at McGill University, 
and will be entering my third year in the fall. I conduct research in natural language processing (NLP) at Mila and the McGill Reasoning and Learning Lab 
under the supervision of Jackie Cheung. My research interests include commonsense reasoning and distributional semantics.

Here is a link to my [CV](documents/cv.pdf).
