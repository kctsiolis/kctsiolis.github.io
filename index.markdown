<h2>Welcome!</h2>
My name is Konstantinos Christopher ("KC") Tsiolis. I am a first-year M.Sc. student in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec) under the supervision of [Adam Oberman](https://www.adamoberman.net/). My current research is on self-supervised learning, deep learning theory (with a focus on random matrix analyses), and causal inference.

I graduated with a B.Sc. from McGill in Honours Mathematics and Computer Science in 2021, which is also when I began working with my current supervisor. During my first two summers of undergraduate studies I was a research assistant in natural language processing (NLP) under the supervision of [Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung), where I worked on word representation learning and computational pragmatics.
