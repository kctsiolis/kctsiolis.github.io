Hello! My name is Konstantinos Christopher ("KC") Tsiolis. I am a final-year Honours Mathematics and Computer Science student at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca). I will be graduating in Fall 2021 before moving on to graduate school in Fall 2022. I currently conduct research in representation learning at [Mila](https://mila.quebec) and the [McGill University Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/) under the supervision of [Adam Oberman](https://www.adamoberman.net/). During my first two summers at McGill, I was a research assistant in natural language processing (NLP) under the supervision of [Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung). 

My broad area of interest is in machine learning, where I wish to learn and contribute as much as I can. More specifically, my main research interests include (but are not limited to) representation learning, deep learning theory, commonsense reasoning, computational pragmatics, and distributional semantics. 

You can view my CV [here](cv.pdf).
