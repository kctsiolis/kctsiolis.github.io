Hello there! I am a second-year PhD student at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) under the supervision of [Murat Erdogdu](ttp://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/). I also currently serve as President of the [Statistics Graduate Student Union](https://sgsu-uoft.github.io) at the University of Toronto. 

I am broadly interested in developing a rigorous theoretical understanding of deep learning. The primary objective of my current research is to characterize learning dynamics under stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using tools from high-dimensional statistics and random matrix theory, with an eye towards *feature learning* and *scaling laws*. 

Previously, I graduated with an MSc in Mathematics and Statistics and a BSc in (Honours) Mathematics and Computer Science at [McGill University](https://mcgill.ca) in my beautiful hometown of Montreal. During my MSc, I wrote a [thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02651.pdf) on contrastive self-supervised learning methods under the supervision of [Adam Oberman](https://www.adamoberman.net/). During my BSc, I worked on problems in natural natural language processing (NLP) under the supervision of [Jackie Cheung](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en) and the [McGill Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca).
